# Introduction
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the world_population_dataset, focusing on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

This project involves creating visualizations to explore the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in a population dataset. Specifically, the focus is on visualizing the distribution of ages or genders using bar charts and histograms. The visualizations help in understanding the demographic distribution and making data-driven decisions. 

# Tools
Tools and Libraries Used
* Google Colab
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

# Conculsion
This EDA process has yielded valuable insights into the dataset, providing a foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
